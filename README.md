# LMS Dashboard Assignment for 6S Consulting

## Project Overview
This is a frontend application built for the Junior Frontend Engineer Round 2 assignment at 6S Consulting. It implements a role-based Learning Management System (LMS) dashboard with the following key features:
- **Role-Based Dashboard**: Tailored views for Admin and Student roles, including widgets like charts (e.g., usage stats for Admin, progress for Student) and tabular data.
- **Chatbot Modal**: A modal accessible from any page, supporting role-specific static Q&A (from mock JSON data) and inline chart rendering within chat messages.
- **Authentication & RBAC**: Mock login with role selection, persisted in local storage, and enforcement of permissions.
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- **Mock Data**: All data (users, metrics, Q&A, charts) is simulated via JSON files â€“ no backend required.

The app supports at least two roles: Admin and Student, as per the problem statement. Built with modular components, clear comments, and best practices for separation of concerns.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React (with Vite for setup).
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) for responsive components.
- **Charting Library**: Recharts for dashboard and in-chat visualizations.
- **State Management**: React Context API for role persistence.
- **Other Tools**: LocalStorage for session continuity, JSON for mock data.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel (link below).
